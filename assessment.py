# PART ONE

# NOTE: We haven't given you function signatures or docstrings for these, so
# you'll need to write your own. These functions also aren't included in the
# doctests above, so make sure to test them on your own.


#    (a) Write a function that takes a town name as a string and evaluates to
#        `True` if it is your hometown, and `False` otherwise.

def is_hometown(town):
    """Returns True if town is my hometown London and False otherwise."""

    if town == "London":
        return True
    else:
        return False


#    (b) Write a function that takes a first and last name as arguments and
#        returns the concatenation of the two names in one string.

def full_name(first_name, last_name):
    """Returns the concatenation of your first name and last name"""

    return first_name + " " + last_name

#    (c) Write a function that takes a home town, a first name, and a last name
#        as arguments, calls both functions from part (a) and (b) and prints
#        "Hi, 'full name here', we're from the same place!", or "Hi 'full name
#        here', where are you from?" depending on what the function from part
#        (a) evaluates to.


def same_place(first_name, last_name, hometown):
    """Evaluates whether we are from the same place.

    If not, function will ask you where you are from."""

        print "Hi %s, we\'re from the same place!" % (name)
    else:
        print raw_input("Hi %s, where are you from?" % (name))


###############################################################################

# PART TWO

# 1. (a) Write a function, `is_berry()`, which takes a fruit name as a string
#        and returns a boolean if the fruit is a "strawberry", "cherry", or
#        "blackberry."


def is_berry(fruit):
    """Determines if fruit is a berry"""

    if fruit == "strawberry" or fruit == "cherry" or fruit == "blackberry":
        return True
    else:
        return False


# (b) Write another function, shipping_cost(), which calculates shipping cost
#     by taking a fruit name as a string and calling the is_berry() function
#     within the shipping_cost() function. Your function should return 0 if
#     is_berry() == True, and 5 if is_berry() == False.

def shipping_cost(fruit):
    """Calculates shipping cost of fruit"""

    if is_berry(fruit):
        return 0
    else:
        return 5


# 2. Make a function that takes in a number and a list of numbers. It should
#    return a new list containing the elements of the input list, along with
#    given number, which should be at the end of the new list.

def append_to_list(lst, num):
    """Creates a new list consisting of the old list with the given number
       added to the end."""

    lst.append(num)
    return lst



# 3. Write a function calculate_price to calculate an item's total cost by
#    adding tax, and any fees required by state law.

#    Your function will take as parameters (in this order): the base price of
#    the item, a two-letter state abbreviation, and the tax percentage (as a
#    two-digit decimal, so, for instance, 5% will be .05). If the user does not
#    provide a tax rate it should default to 5%.

#    CA law requires stores to collect a 3% recycling fee, PA requires a $2
#    highway safety fee, and in MA, there is a commonwealth fund fee of $1 for
#    items with a base price under $100 and $3 for items $100 or more. Fees are
#    added *after* the tax is calculated.

#    Your function should return the total cost of the item, including tax and
#    fees.


def calculate_price(base_price, state, tax=0.05):
    """Returns the total cost of an item after adding tax and various state fees"""

    tax_multiplier = 1 + tax
    item_cost = base_price * tax_multiplier
    if state == "CA":
        reclying_fee = 0.03 * base_price
        item_cost = item_cost + reclying_fee
    elif state == "PA":
        highway_safety_fee = 2.00
        item_cost = item_cost + highway_safety_fee
    elif state == "MA":
        if base_price < 100:
            commonwealth_fee = 1.00
        else:
            commonwealth_fee = 3.00
        item_cost = item_cost + commonwealth_fee
    return item_cost

# PART THREE: ADVANCED

# NOTE: We haven't given you function signatures and docstrings for these, so
# you'll need to write your own. These functions also aren't included in the
# doctests above, so make sure to test them on your own.


# 1. Make a new function that takes in a list and any number of additional
# arguments, appends them to the list, and returns the entire list. Hint: this
# isn't something we've discussed yet in class; you might need to google how to
# write a Python function that takes in an arbitrary number of arguments.

    """Adds each of the items in arg to the end of our input list and then returns it."""

    for item in arg:
        lst.append(item)
    return lst

# 2. Make a new function with a nested inner function.
# The outer function will take in a word.
# The inner function will multiply that word by 3.
# Then, the outer function will call the inner function.
# Output will be the original function argument and the result of the inner
# function.

# Example:

#>>> outer("Balloonicorn")
#('Balloonicorn', 'BalloonicornBalloonicornBalloonicorn')
